# Challenges üßë‚Äçüíª

This repository contains some code challenges that I consider important to learn ü§î

The code starts with an explanaition of what is the problem an a few examples of how should it work for example:


Given an array of integers, create a function that returns the smallest missing positive integer from the array.

You should assume that the input array will have at least one element and all elements will be integers.

* The function should return 1 if no missing positive integers are found in the array.

* The function should handle negative integers as well.

Here's an example of how the function should work:
```JavaScript
const array = [3, 4, -1, 1];
console.log(smallestMissingPositive(array)); // Output: 2

const array2 = [1, 2, 0];
console.log(smallestMissingPositive(array2)); // Output: 3

const array3 = [-3, -2, -1, 0];
console.log(smallestMissingPositive(array3)); // Output: 1
```
